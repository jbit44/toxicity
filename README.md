# The Toxicity Dataset
*by [Surge AI](https://www.surgehq.ai)*

Saving the internet is fun. Combing through thousands of online comments to build a toxicity dataset isn't. That's why we're creating the world's largest dataset of social media toxicity — so you can skip the slog and get to work.  

We hope you find this dataset useful, whether you want to flag hateful speech, develop content moderation tools, or build classifiers to detect toxic messages.

Need a larger dataset of toxicity to train your ML models, or toxicity in other languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and 17+ more)? We work with top AI and Safety companies around the world. Reach out to team@surgehq.ai!

## Dataset
This repo contains 500 toxic and 500 non-toxic comments from a variety of popular social media platforms. Click on [toxicity_en.csv](https://github.com/surge-ai/toxicity/blob/main/toxicity_en.csv) to see a spreadsheet of 1000 English examples.

## Columns
* `text`: the text of the comment
* `is_toxic`: whether or not the comment is toxic 

## Future
We'll be adding more languages and annotations (e.g., augmenting each comment with a severity ranking, adding categories, etc) over time.
